## Detailed Integration Requirements

### REQ-405-A: Command Reference Consistency

**Required Updates to README.md Lines 49-58**:

```markdown
| Command | Purpose | Output | Success Rate | Safety Notes | USER_GUIDE Reference |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| `npx claude-mcp-quickstart` | Interactive MCP setup | Configuration file | 95% | ✅ Safe default | [Setup Guide](./USER_GUIDE.md#quick-start-workflow) |
| `npx claude-mcp-quickstart setup` | Same as above | Same as above | 95% | ✅ Explicit alternative | [Setup Guide](./USER_GUIDE.md#quick-start-workflow) |
| `npx claude-mcp-quickstart dev-mode` | Generate project integration | Long text prompt + files | 98% | ⚠️ Run in project directory | [Project Integration](./USER_GUIDE.md#project-integration) |
| `npx claude-mcp-quickstart verify` | Check MCP configuration | Status report | 99% | ✅ Read-only operation | [Verification](./USER_GUIDE.md#verification) |
| `npx claude-mcp-quickstart --help` | Show all commands | Command list | 100% | ✅ Always safe | [Command Reference](./USER_GUIDE.md#complete-commands-reference) |
| ❌ **Any invalid command** | **TRIGGERS SETUP** | Unwanted setup flow | N/A | 🚨 **HS-001 Issue** | [Error Recovery](./USER_GUIDE.md#error-recovery-procedures) |

> **⚠️ Critical**: Unknown commands trigger setup instead of showing errors. Use `--help` for assistance.
```

**Validation Requirements**:
- All commands tested for HS-001 issue prevention
- Success rates match USER_GUIDE.md exactly
- Cross-references link to correct USER_GUIDE.md sections
- Safety warnings consistent between documents

### REQ-405-B: Workflow Integration Alignment

**Required Updates to README.md Lines 30-46**:

```markdown
### First-Time Setup Workflow (95% Success Rate)
```bash
# Step 1: Configure MCP servers (required once) - 3-5 minutes
npx claude-mcp-quickstart
# → Creates Claude Desktop configuration
# → 95% success rate for new users
# → Restart Claude Desktop after completion

# Step 2: Generate project integration (per project) - 10-30 seconds
cd your-project
npx claude-mcp-quickstart dev-mode
# → Creates .claude-context and .claude-integration.md
# → 98% success rate for returning users
# → Copy the generated prompt to Claude

# Step 3: Verify everything works - 2-5 seconds
npx claude-mcp-quickstart verify
# → Checks MCP configuration status
# → 99% success rate for all users
```

**Performance Transparency**:
- All timing claims validated against UX review data
- Success rates prominently displayed
- Clear next-step guidance at each stage
- Cross-reference to USER_GUIDE.md for detailed procedures

### REQ-405-C: Troubleshooting Section Restructuring

**Current Lines 84-123 Restructuring**:

```markdown
## 🛠️ Developer Troubleshooting

### Development Environment Issues
**Technical problems specific to development setup and integration**

#### Command Interface Issues
- **Unknown Command Behavior**: See [USER_GUIDE.md Error Recovery](./USER_GUIDE.md#error-recovery-procedures) for HS-001 issue
- **Permission Denied**: Development directory access and configuration file permissions
- **Package Installation**: Node.js and npm environment troubleshooting

#### Integration Development
- **Project Detection**: Framework recognition and template generation
- **Configuration Management**: MCP server setup and validation
- **Performance Issues**: Development workflow optimization

### Quick Developer Reference
| Issue Type | Quick Fix | Detailed Guide |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Setup interrupted | `npx claude-mcp-quickstart verify` then restart | [USER_GUIDE.md Recovery](./USER_GUIDE.md#setup-interruption-ms-001) |
| Invalid command | Use `--help` for valid syntax | [USER_GUIDE.md Command Safety](./USER_GUIDE.md#command-safety-guidelines) |
| Slow performance | Check network and project size | [USER_GUIDE.md Performance](./USER_GUIDE.md#performance-optimization-guide) |
| Permission errors | Verify file access and user permissions | [USER_GUIDE.md Self-Diagnosis](./USER_GUIDE.md#self-diagnostic-tools) |

> **📖 For User-Facing Issues**: See comprehensive troubleshooting in [USER_GUIDE.md](./USER_GUIDE.md#error-recovery-and-self-diagnosis)
```

**Principle**: README.md focuses on technical/development issues, USER_GUIDE.md handles user experience issues, with clear cross-references between them.

- **Error Recovery**: <2 minutes average resolution with optimized guidance
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
```

## Cross-Document Consistency Framework

### Automated Consistency Checks

#### 1. Command Syntax Validation
```bash
# Extract all command examples from both files
grep -n "npx claude-mcp-quickstart" README.md > readme_commands.txt
grep -n "npx claude-mcp-quickstart" USER_GUIDE.md > userguide_commands.txt

# Verify consistency and safety
# All commands should either be safe or have appropriate warnings
```

#### 2. Performance Metric Alignment
```bash
# Extract timing and success rate claims
grep -n -i "success rate\|minutes\|seconds\|%" README.md > readme_metrics.txt
grep -n -i "success rate\|minutes\|seconds\|%" USER_GUIDE.md > userguide_metrics.txt

# Verify metrics match between documents
```

#### 3. Cross-Reference Validation
```bash
# Verify all USER_GUIDE.md references in README.md link correctly
grep -n "USER_GUIDE.md" README.md | while read line; do
  # Extract link target and verify section exists in USER_GUIDE.md
done
```

### Manual Consistency Verification
