## Pro Tips

1. **Chain Commands**: Combine multiple prompts for complex workflows
2. **Save Successful Prompts**: Keep a personal library of prompts that work well
3. **Iterate Quickly**: Use "continue" or "fix that" for rapid iteration
4. **Be Specific**: The more detail you provide, the better the output
5. **Use Memory**: Have Claude remember your preferences across sessions

## Remember

After running any of these prompts, you can always say:
- "Make it better"
- "Add more features"
- "Fix any issues"
- "Explain what you did"
- "Create documentation"

Claude with MCP is your coding superpower - use it! ðŸš€
