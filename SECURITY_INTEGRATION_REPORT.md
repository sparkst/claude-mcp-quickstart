REQ-SEC-002: Input sanitization escapes shell metacharacters
Result: "[DOLLAR][LPAREN]malicious_command[RPAREN]" - SAFE
```

#### ❌ BLOCKED: Script Injection
```bash
# Previous vulnerability
npx claude-mcp-quickstart "<script>alert('xss')</script>"

# Current protection
HTML entity encoding + character mapping
Result: "&lt;script&gt;alert[LPAREN]&apos;xss&apos;[RPAREN]&lt;[SLASH]script&gt;" - SAFE
```

#### ❌ BLOCKED: Path Traversal
```bash
# Previous vulnerability
npx claude-mcp-quickstart "../../../etc/passwd"

# Current protection
Path traversal detection + safe encoding
Result: "[DOTDOT][SLASH]etc[SLASH]passwd" - SAFE
```

#### ❌ BLOCKED: Template Injection
```javascript
// Previous vulnerability
Generated content could contain unescaped user input

// Current protection
Smart escaping with malicious pattern detection:
- Full escaping for dangerous patterns
- Readable escaping for legitimate paths
- Context-aware security decisions
```

### Performance Optimizations Security Impact

#### ✅ SECURE: Test Parallelization
- **Configuration**: `fileParallelism: false` in vitest.config.js
- **Security Impact**: NONE - Sequential execution prevents race conditions
- **Risk Level**: LOW - No security boundaries affected

#### ✅ SECURE: Async/Await Patterns
- **Implementation**: Consistent async/await usage across 33 files
- **Security Impact**: POSITIVE - Proper error handling prevents information leaks
- **Risk Level**: LOW - No injection vectors introduced

#### ✅ SECURE: Memory Management
- **Implementation**: No lazy loading or caching that could introduce vulnerabilities
- **Security Impact**: NEUTRAL - No security boundaries compromised
- **Risk Level**: LOW - Standard Node.js memory patterns

## Security Integration Points

### 1. CLI → Template Security Handoff
- **Integration Point**: CLI processes commands → Templates generate output
- **Security Boundary**: CLI sanitization + Template escaping
- **Validation**: ✅ Double protection ensures no bypass possible
- **Test Coverage**: cli-security.spec.js + brain-connection.spec.js

### 2. File System → Template Security
- **Integration Point**: File operations → Template rendering
- **Security Controls**:
  - fs.promises used safely throughout
  - No eval() or dynamic code execution
  - Path validation in place
- **Risk Assessment**: LOW - No unsafe file operations detected

### 3. Test Infrastructure → Production Security
- **Security Boundary**: Test mocks must not weaken production security
- **Validation**: ✅ All security tests use proper isolation
- **Mock Analysis**: Security-critical functions properly mocked without bypassing controls

## Security Test Distribution Analysis

### High-Security Test Files (17 files with security content):
1. `cli-security.spec.js` - 16 dedicated security tests
2. `brain-connection.spec.js` - Template injection prevention
3. `brain-connection-ux.spec.js` - XSS prevention validation
4. `setup.spec.js` - Configuration security
5. `config-analyzer.spec.js` - Config validation security
6. `anti-pattern-tests.spec.js` - Security anti-patterns
7. Plus 11 additional files with security-related validations

- `child_process.spawn`: Used only in packaging tests (isolated environment)
- `child_process.exec`: Used only in integration tests (mocked for security)

### Security Validation:
- ✅ No dynamic command execution in CLI router
- ✅ No user input passed to child processes
- ✅ All exec operations in controlled test environments

console.error(`[SECURITY] Unknown command attempted: ${sanitizedCommand}`);
```

### Monitoring Recommendations:
1. **Alert Triggers**: Monitor for `[SECURITY]` log entries
2. **Pattern Detection**: Track sanitization patterns for attack identification
3. **Threshold Monitoring**: Alert on repeated unknown command attempts
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Security test execution in automated pipelines

## Vulnerability Assessment Results

### CRITICAL: ✅ RESOLVED

### HIGH: ✅ RESOLVED
- Information disclosure in error messages - Fixed with minimal disclosure
- Path traversal in command processing - Fixed with path encoding

### MEDIUM: ✅ RESOLVED
- Input validation bypass - Fixed with character-by-character sanitization
- XSS in generated content - Fixed with context-aware escaping

### LOW: ✅ MAINTAINED
- Race conditions in tests - Prevented with sequential execution
- Memory exhaustion attacks - Limited with input length restrictions

## Security Regression Prevention

### Test Infrastructure Safeguards:
1. **Isolation**: All security tests properly isolated
2. **Mocking**: Security-critical functions mocked without bypassing controls
3. **Validation**: Real attack vectors tested, not just mock validation
4. **Coverage**: 16 dedicated CLI security tests + distributed template security tests

### Development Workflow Security:
1. **TDD Enforcement**: Security requirements must have failing tests first
2. **Requirements Traceability**: All security fixes traceable to requirements
3. **Code Review**: Security-sensitive changes require additional review
4. **Automated Testing**: Security tests run in CI/CD pipeline

## Performance vs Security Trade-offs

### ✅ OPTIMAL BALANCE ACHIEVED:
- **Input Sanitization**: Character-by-character processing (minimal overhead)
- **Length Limiting**: 50-character maximum (prevents DoS attacks)
- **Smart Escaping**: Context-aware decisions (performance + security)
- **Test Execution**: Sequential file processing (safety over speed)
