## Priority 1: Essential Security Section Enhancements

### 1.1 Replace Current Security Section (Lines 214-218)

**Current Content:**
```markdown
### Security
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables in CI/CD
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Keep Claude Desktop updated
```

**Recommended Enhancement:**
```markdown
## üîí Security & Token Protection

### How Your Tokens Are Protected

- **Secure Storage**: Tokens encrypted in Claude Desktop configuration
- **Memory Safety**: Tokens automatically cleared from memory after use
- **Format Validation**: Real-time validation prevents invalid tokens

### Token Security Best Practices
- **Never commit tokens** to version control or share in plain text
- **Use environment variables** for CI/CD and automated environments
- **Rotate tokens quarterly** or when team members change
- **Generate tokens with minimal required permissions** for each service
- **Keep Claude Desktop updated** for latest security enhancements

### Secure Token Management
- **Update Tokens**: Run setup again and enter new token when prompted
- **Remove Tokens**: Enter '-' when prompted to safely remove stored tokens
- **Verify Setup**: Use `npx mcp-quickstart verify` to check configuration
```

### 1.2 Add Security Error Recovery Section

**New Section to Add After Security Section:**
```markdown
## üõ†Ô∏è Security Error Recovery

### Common Security Issues & Solutions

#### Invalid Token Format
**Symptoms**: "Invalid token format" error during setup
**Causes**: Token doesn't match expected format (ghp_*, sbp_*, etc.)
**Solutions**:
1. Verify token format matches service requirements:
   - GitHub: `ghp_` or `ghs_` prefix
   - Supabase: `sbp_` or `sba_` prefix
   - Brave: 32+ character uppercase key
   - Tavily: `tvly-` prefix
2. Regenerate token from official service if format is incorrect
3. Copy token carefully without extra spaces or characters

#### Token Permission Issues
**Symptoms**: Setup succeeds but tools fail during use
**Causes**: Token lacks required permissions for MCP operations
**Solutions**:
1. Check token permissions in service dashboard
2. Regenerate token with required scopes:
   - GitHub: `repo`, `read:org` permissions
   - Supabase: Full access or project-specific permissions
3. Update token in setup: `npx mcp-quickstart setup`

#### Rate Limiting Protection
**Symptoms**: "Rate limit exceeded" or "Too many requests" warnings
**Causes**: Security protection against rapid-fire requests
**Solutions**:
1. Wait 60 seconds before retrying operation
2. Check for automated scripts making rapid requests
3. Verify only one setup process is running

#### Complete Token Reset
If you encounter persistent security issues:
```bash
# Remove all stored tokens and start fresh
npx mcp-quickstart setup
# For each service, enter '-' to remove existing tokens
# Then enter new tokens when prompted
```
```

### 1.3 Enhance API Key Management Section (Lines 189-194)

**Current Content:**
```markdown
### API Key Management
- Safe storage: Keys are stored securely in Claude Desktop config
- Masked display: Setup shows `sk-...3aF` instead of full keys
- Easy updates: Run setup again to update keys
- Environment override: Use env vars for CI/CD
```

**Enhanced Version:**
```markdown
### API Key Management & Security

#### Secure Token Storage
- **Location**: Tokens stored in Claude Desktop configuration file
- **Encryption**: Configuration data protected by system security
- **Access Control**: Only Claude Desktop and MCP tools can access tokens
- **Isolation**: Tokens separated from other application data

#### Token Display & Masking
- **Masked Format**: Tokens shown as `prefix***suffix` (e.g., `ghp_1***456`)
- **Security Indication**: Masking confirms secure handling
- **Verification**: See masked tokens during setup to verify storage
- **No Plain Text**: Full tokens never displayed after initial entry

#### Safe Token Updates
1. **Run Setup**: `npx mcp-quickstart setup`
2. **See Current**: Masked tokens displayed for verification
3. **Update Options**:
   - **Keep Current**: Press Enter to maintain existing token
   - **Remove Token**: Enter '-' to delete stored token
   - **Replace Token**: Enter new token to update
4. **Immediate Effect**: Changes take effect after Claude Desktop restart

#### Environment Variable Support
```bash
# For CI/CD environments, use environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-supabase-token"
export BRAVE_API_KEY="your-brave-key"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-key"

# Tools will use environment variables if available
npx mcp-quickstart dev-mode
```
```
