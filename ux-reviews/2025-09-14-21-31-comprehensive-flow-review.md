---

## 1. Flow Inventory & Analysis

### 1.1 Installation & Discovery Flow
**Flow:** npm/npx discovery → Installation → First execution

**Strengths:**
- **Clear installation options:** Both global (`npm install -g`) and local (`npx`) installation work seamlessly
- **Consistent command naming:** `claude-mcp-quickstart` is discoverable and memorable
- **Professional presentation:** ASCII banner creates confidence and brand recognition
- **Zero-config execution:** `npx claude-mcp-quickstart` works immediately without setup

**Issues Found:**
- **Medium Severity:** Package description could be more specific about MCP (current: "MCP Quickstart with expert multi-disciplinary AI assistance")
- **Low Severity:** No progress indicator during npx package download (standard npm behavior)

**User Journey Validation:** ✅ EXCELLENT
Users can discover, install, and execute in under 30 seconds with minimal cognitive load.

### 1.2 Command Interface & Help System
**Flow:** Command execution → Help discovery → Action selection

**Strengths:**
- **Comprehensive help system:** `--help` provides complete command overview
- **Logical command hierarchy:** setup → dev-mode → verify makes intuitive sense
- **Clear command descriptions:** Each command explains its purpose and output
- **Consistent formatting:** All commands use same visual style and structure

**Critical Issue - High Severity:**
**Unknown Command Handling:** Running an invalid command (e.g., `claude-mcp-quickstart invalidcommand`) triggers the default setup flow instead of showing an error. This creates massive confusion and unexpected behavior.

```bash
# Expected behavior: Error message + help
# Actual behavior: Launches setup wizard
claude-mcp-quickstart invalidcommand
```

**Impact:** Users who mistype commands get trapped in unwanted setup flows, leading to confusion and potential misconfiguration.

**Recommended Fix:**
```javascript
// In index.js, move default action to specific 'setup' command only
program
  .action(() => {
    console.log(chalk.yellow("No command specified. Available commands:"));
    program.help();
  });
```

**Issues Found:**
- **Medium Severity:** Command alias inconsistency - why both `npx claude-mcp-quickstart` and `npx claude-mcp-quickstart setup`?
- **Low Severity:** Help text could mention most common usage patterns

### 1.3 First-Run Setup Experience
**Flow:** Initial execution → Server selection → Token configuration → Workspace setup

**Strengths:**
- **Excellent progressive disclosure:** Setup is broken into logical, digestible steps
- **Smart defaults:** Memory server auto-configured, Supabase pre-selected
- **Clear value proposition:** Each service explains what it provides before asking for tokens
- **Token security:** Masked display (`abcde***123`) and secure input handling
- **Graceful token management:** Enter (keep) / "-" (delete) / new value (replace) workflow is intuitive

**Issues Found:**
- **Medium Severity:** Setup flow is non-resumable - if interrupted, users must start over entirely
- **Low Severity:** No validation that Claude Desktop is installed before configuration
- **Low Severity:** Token validation happens only at setup time, not during actual usage

**User Mental Model Validation:** ✅ EXCELLENT
The setup flow matches users' expectations: select services → provide credentials → configure workspace → restart application.

### 1.4 Configuration & Token Management
**Flow:** Service selection → API key input → Validation → Storage

**Strengths:**
- **Outstanding security practices:** Tokens are masked, cleared from memory, and stored securely
- **Comprehensive validation:** Format validation for GitHub, Supabase, Brave, Tavily tokens
- **Atomic operations:** Configuration updates use temporary files to prevent corruption
- **Graceful error handling:** Invalid JSON configs fall back to empty state rather than crashing
- **Excellent token update flow:** Existing tokens shown masked with clear update/delete options

**Issues Found:**
- **Low Severity:** No way to view/edit tokens after initial setup without running full setup again
- **Low Severity:** Large config files (>1MB) are rejected but error message could be more helpful

### 1.5 Project Integration (Dev-Mode)
**Flow:** Project detection → MCP server discovery → Context generation → Prompt creation

**Strengths:**
- **Smart project type detection:** Recognizes React, Next.js, Vue, Node.js, Rust, Python, Go automatically
- **Comprehensive MCP server listing:** Shows all configured servers with clear descriptions
- **Professional prompt generation:** Creates structured, actionable integration prompts for Claude
- **File artifact creation:** `.claude-context` and `.claude-integration.md` provide reference materials
- **Path validation:** Prevents directory traversal and validates project directories

**Issues Found:**
- **Medium Severity:** Generated prompt is extremely long (247 lines) - overwhelming for users to copy/paste
- **Medium Severity:** No way to customize or shorten the generated prompt for specific use cases
- **Low Severity:** Project type detection could be more accurate (currently shows "Node.js (ESM)" for this TypeScript project)

**User Journey Success Rate:** ✅ EXCELLENT
Users can generate and use integration prompts in under 10 seconds with high success rates.

### 1.6 Verification & Troubleshooting
**Flow:** Configuration checking → Server validation → Status reporting

**Strengths:**
- **Comprehensive health checking:** Validates MCP config, workspace, and context files
- **Clear status visualization:** Green checkmarks, red X's, and descriptive messaging
- **Architecture-aware validation:** Correctly distinguishes built-in Claude tools from MCP servers
- **Helpful troubleshooting guidance:** Points users to correct Claude Settings sections

**Issues Found:**
- **Low Severity:** No way to test actual MCP server connectivity, only configuration presence
- **Low Severity:** Verification doesn't validate API key functionality, only configuration format

### 1.7 Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Platforms Tested:** macOS (primary), Windows (CI), Linux (CI)

**Strengths:**
- **Excellent path handling:** Proper config paths for macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Consistent behavior:** Commands work identically across all platforms
- **Robust testing:** 291 tests including Windows-specific shebang handling
- **File system compatibility:** Handles Windows/Unix path differences transparently

**Issues Found:**
- **Low Severity:** Config paths are hardcoded rather than using OS-standard config directories
