# Current Requirements - UX Flow Analysis & USER_GUIDE.md Update Strategy

> **SCOPE**: Analyze current optimized UX state and create comprehensive strategy for deploying specialized agents to update USER_GUIDE.md based on actual implemented flows and recent UX optimization findings.

## REQ-401: Analyze Current UX Optimization State
- Acceptance: Complete analysis of latest UX review findings and current implementation state
- Coverage: Review `/ux-reviews/2025-09-14-21-31-comprehensive-flow-review.md` findings (A- grade, 92/100 score)
- Critical Issues: High severity unknown command behavior, medium severity prompt length and setup resumability
- Performance: 95% onboarding success rate, 98% returning user success rate
- Non-Goals: Creating new UX features (analysis only)

## REQ-402: Assess Current User Guide Accuracy
- Acceptance: Identify gaps between current USER_GUIDE.md and actual implemented UX flows
- Current State: USER_GUIDE.md shows basic 3-step workflow (setup, dev-mode, verify)
- Missing Elements: Error recovery flows, accessibility features, performance optimizations
- Outdated Elements: Command examples that may trigger unknown command behavior issue
- Integration: Verify README.md cross-references and consistency

## REQ-403: Design Parallel Agent Deployment Strategy
- Acceptance: Create strategy for deploying specialized agents to analyze different UX aspects
- Agent Assignments:
  - **CLI UX Agent**: Command interface, help system, error handling flows
  - **Onboarding Agent**: Setup experience, first-time user journey, token management
  - **Performance Agent**: Speed optimizations impact on UX, loading states, feedback
  - **Security Agent**: Security features user experience, token masking, validation flows
  - **Accessibility Agent**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, visual design
  - **Documentation Agent**: Help system UX, troubleshooting clarity, cross-references
- Coordination: Parallel execution with consolidated findings integration

## REQ-404: Plan USER_GUIDE.md Restructuring Requirements
- Acceptance: Comprehensive update specification based on UX analysis findings
- Structure Updates: Reflect actual 95% success rate onboarding flow
- Content Updates: Include error recovery procedures, accessibility features
- Command Updates: Fix unknown command behavior examples, add proper error handling
- Integration Updates: Ensure README.md integration points remain accurate
- Success Metrics: Align with actual performance data (3-5 min setup, 10-30 sec returning user)

## REQ-405: Verify README.md Integration Consistency
- Acceptance: Ensure README.md properly references updated user guidance
- Cross-References: Command guide table consistency with USER_GUIDE.md
- Workflow Examples: Setup → dev-mode → verify flow accuracy
- Troubleshooting: Common issues alignment between documents
- Performance Claims: Verify performance metrics consistency across documents

## REQ-406: Create Comprehensive UX Flow Documentation
- Acceptance: Document actual implemented UX flows for future reference
- Flow Mapping: Installation → Setup → Project Integration → Verification
- Error Scenarios: Map error recovery flows and user guidance paths
- Success Paths: Document 95% onboarding and 98% returning user flows
- Performance Data: Include actual timing metrics and success rates
- Accessibility Features: Document keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Non-Goals
- Implementing new UX features (analysis and documentation only)
- Modifying command behavior (documentation update only)
- Creating new agent implementations (deployment strategy only)
- Changing core workflow structure (documenting existing optimized flows)

## Success Criteria
1. Accurate understanding of current optimized UX state
2. Comprehensive agent deployment strategy for parallel analysis
3. USER_GUIDE.md update requirements that reflect actual user experience
4. README.md integration verification ensuring consistency
5. Complete UX flow documentation for future reference
6. Agent coordination plan for efficient parallel execution
