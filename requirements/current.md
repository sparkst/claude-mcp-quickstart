# Current Requirements - Brain Connection Security & Reliability Fixes

## REQ-201: Brain Connection Integration Status (FIXED)
- Acceptance: Brain connection integration must return proper success/failure status for setup flow
- Acceptance: Function returns structured result object with success boolean and status details
- Acceptance: Error boundaries prevent exceptions from crashing parent process
- Acceptance: All return paths provide consistent interface for programmatic use
- Notes: Main orchestration function in brain-connection.js line 178

## REQ-202: Template Injection Prevention (FIXED)  
- Acceptance: Connection file generation must escape template content and prevent injection attacks
- Acceptance: All user inputs (projectPath, projectType, mcpServers) must be sanitized
- Acceptance: Template string interpolation must use safe escaping methods
- Acceptance: Generated file content must not execute malicious code when opened
- Notes: Function createBrainConnectionFile starting line 13

## REQ-203: UX Pattern Consistency (FIXED)
- Acceptance: User experience display must follow existing chalk color patterns from codebase
- Acceptance: Color usage must match established patterns in setup.js and other modules
- Acceptance: Visual hierarchy must be consistent with existing CLI output
- Acceptance: Message formatting must align with codebase conventions
- Notes: Function displayBrainConnectionPrompt starting line 90

## REQ-204: Efficient Connection Detection (FIXED)
- Acceptance: Connection detection polling must implement efficient resource cleanup and backoff
- Acceptance: Polling interval must use exponential backoff starting at 100ms
- Acceptance: Resource cleanup must clear intervals and free memory on completion
- Acceptance: File system watchers must be properly disposed to prevent leaks
- Notes: Function waitForClaudeConnection starting line 110

## REQ-205: Structured Timeout Handling (FIXED)
- Acceptance: Timeout handling must provide structured status returns for programmatic use
- Acceptance: Timeout responses must include machine-readable reason codes
- Acceptance: Error boundaries must prevent timeout exceptions from propagating
- Acceptance: Graceful degradation must maintain consistent return interface
- Notes: Function handleConnectionTimeout starting line 139

## REQ-206: JSON Validation & Error Handling (FIXED)
- Acceptance: Success state management must validate JSON content and handle malformed responses
- Acceptance: JSON parsing must be wrapped in try-catch with fallback behavior
- Acceptance: Malformed JSON files must not crash the connection process
- Acceptance: Status file validation must verify required fields before proceeding
- Notes: Function displayConnectionSuccess starting line 156
