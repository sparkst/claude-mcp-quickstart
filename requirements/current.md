- Notes: Users need to understand ROI of setup effort immediately

## REQ-309: Robust Configuration Parsing
- Acceptance: Handle missing, malformed, or incomplete Claude configuration files
- Acceptance: Provide specific error messages for configuration issues
- Acceptance: Gracefully degrade when configuration analysis fails
- Acceptance: Follow existing error handling and security patterns
- Non-Goals: Fixing configuration files automatically, bypassing Claude security
- Notes: Must be resilient to user environment variations and edge cases

## REQ-310: Targeted Troubleshooting System
- Acceptance: Detect common setup failures (missing filesystem, invalid tokens, etc.)
- Acceptance: Provide specific, step-by-step resolution guidance
- Acceptance: Handle edge cases like multiple Claude installations or custom configs
- Acceptance: Generate troubleshooting content that's context-aware
- Non-Goals: Debugging Claude itself, fixing system-level issues
- Notes: Focus on issues within our control and common user mistakes

## REQ-311: Package Distribution Integrity
- Acceptance: All required modules included in npm package files array
- Acceptance: Global installation resolves all module imports without errors
- Acceptance: Packaging workflow validated with integration tests
- Acceptance: Build artifacts excluded from repository to prevent tampering
- Acceptance: All tests must pass before any packaging/distribution
- Acceptance: Clean repository with no committed build artifacts (.tgz files)
- Non-Goals: Complex dependency management, supporting non-npm distributions
- Notes: Critical for preventing ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors on global installation
- Notes: Critical for professional distribution and user experience
