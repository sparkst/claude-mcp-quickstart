## 1. NEW DEVELOPER ONBOARDING FLOW

### 1.1 First-Time Setup Experience

**Scenario: Developer discovers Claude MCP Quickstart**
- **Entry Point**: Fresh project setup or existing project integration
- **Success Criteria**: Developer understands system purpose within 5 minutes
- **Testing Focus**: Clarity, simplicity, immediate value

**Test Cases:**

**TD-001: QNEW Discovery and Execution**
```
Given: Developer has never used CLAUDE.md workflow

2. Validate template guidance effectiveness
3. Test REQ ID generation and formatting
4. Verify lock file creation transparency
```

**TD-003: Complete Workflow Walkthrough**
```
Given: Developer has basic requirements
When: They progress through full QNEW→QGIT workflow
Then: Each step provides clear guidance and feedback
Expected UX: Step-by-step progress, clear next actions, success indicators

Testing Steps:
1. Execute complete workflow with simple feature

Then: System maintains context appropriately
Expected UX: Clear project boundaries, preserved settings, quick context recovery
```

---

## 3. ERROR RECOVERY AND GUIDANCE

### 3.1 Workflow Interruption Handling

**TD-009: TDD Enforcement Blocking**
```
Given: Developer tries to implement without tests
When: test-writer blocks implementation
Then: Clear guidance provided for resolution
Expected UX: Specific error messages, corrective actions, learning opportunities

Error Scenarios:
- Implementation before tests
- Tests that don't fail initially
- Missing REQ ID references
- Invalid test formats
```

**TD-010: Agent Failure Recovery**
```
Given: Agent fails during workflow execution
When: System detects failure
Then: Graceful degradation with recovery options
Expected UX: Clear failure explanation, alternative paths, manual override options
```

**TD-011: Quality Gate Failures**
```
Given: Code fails quality checks
When: QCHECK or QCHECKF reveals issues
Then: Actionable feedback with improvement guidance
Expected UX: Specific issues highlighted, improvement suggestions, re-check workflow
```

### 3.2 Learning and Improvement

**TD-012: Progressive Error Education**
```
Test Focus: How system teaches better practices
- Repetitive error handling
- Best practice suggestions
- Anti-pattern detection
- Skill development tracking
```

## 4. CROSS-TERRITORY INTEGRATION UX

### 4.1 Territory A-D Coordination

**TD-013: Seamless Territory Handoffs**
```
Given: Feature implementation spans multiple territories
When: Workflow moves between territory responsibilities
Then: Handoffs are transparent and smooth
Expected UX: Context preservation, status clarity, progress indicators

Territory Boundaries:
- A: Core CLAUDE.md principles → B: TDD Enforcement
- B: TDD Enforcement → C: Agent Coordination
- C: Agent Coordination → D: System Integration
```

**TD-014: Territory Failure Isolation**
```
Given: One territory encounters issues
When: Other territories remain functional
Then: System degrades gracefully
Expected UX: Clear fault boundaries, alternative workflows, minimal impact
```

### 4.2 End-to-End Consistency

**TD-015: Unified Experience Validation**
```
Test Focus: Consistent UX across all territories
- Command syntax consistency
- Error message uniformity
- Help system coherence
- Visual/textual design patterns
```

## 5. ACCESSIBILITY TESTING

### 5.1 Keyboard Navigation and Focus Management

**TD-016: Keyboard-Only Operation**

Then: All functionality remains accessible
Expected UX: Logical tab order, clear focus indicators, shortcut keys

Accessibility Requirements:
- Tab order follows logical workflow progression
- Focus indicators clearly visible (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
- Keyboard shortcuts for all primary actions
- Screen reader compatibility for status messages
```

**TD-017: Focus Order Validation**
```
Test Focus: Logical focus progression

```
Given: Developer has vision accessibility needs
When: They use system visual feedback
Then: Information remains accessible without color dependency
Expected UX: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, text alternatives, high contrast options

Color Accessibility:
- Success/error states: Use icons + text, not just color
- Code syntax highlighting: Multiple visual cues
- Progress indicators: Text + visual progress
- Agent status: Icons + labels + descriptions
```

**TD-019: Screen Reader Compatibility**
```
Test Focus: Non-visual interaction patterns
