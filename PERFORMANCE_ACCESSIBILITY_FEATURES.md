## Performance Accessibility Implementation

### Code-Level Accessibility Features

**Lazy Loading for AT Compatibility:**
```javascript
// REQ-PERF-002: Early exit for simple commands avoids AT conflicts
if (isVersionCommand) {
  console.log(packageJson.version);
  process.exit(0); // Immediate exit, no resource contention
}
```

**Memory-Efficient Processing:**
```javascript
// REQ-PERF-005: Minimal memory footprint supports concurrent AT operation
const loadDependencies = async () => {
  // Only load what's needed, when needed
  const { program } = await import("commander");
  const chalk = (await import("chalk")).default;
  return { program, chalk };
};
```

**Predictable Response Timing:**
```javascript
// REQ-PERF-006: Consistent banner behavior for screen readers
const shouldShowBanner = !process.argv.some((arg) =>
  skipBannerCommands.includes(arg)
);
// Predictable output structure for AT parsing
```

### Error Handling Accessibility

**Accessible Error Messages:**
```javascript
// REQ-SEC-003: Screen reader friendly error handling
function handleUnknownCommand(command) {
  const sanitizedCommand = sanitizeInput(command);

  // Clear, immediate error message
  const errorMessage = `❌ Invalid command: "${sanitizedCommand}"`;
  console.error(chalk.red(errorMessage));

  // Helpful next step without overwhelming information
  console.log(chalk.gray("Use --help to see available commands"));
}
```
