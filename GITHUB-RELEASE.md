# 🚀 GitHub Release Announcement

## MCP Quickstart v2.4.0 - Enterprise-Grade Security & Simplified UX

### 🚨 Critical Security Updates & Architecture Corrections

```bash
npx mcp-quickstart
```

**v2.4.0 delivers critical security fixes, architectural corrections, and a dramatically simplified user experience.**

---

## 🎯 What is MCP Quickstart?

We built this because setting up MCP (Model Context Protocol) was too complicated. Configuration files, manual installations, environment variables... who has time for that?

**MCP Quickstart** solves this. One command gives Claude:
- 📂 **File system access** - Read/write files on your computer
- 🔍 **Web search** - Brave & Tavily integration
- 🐙 **GitHub management** - Repos, issues, PRs
- 🧠 **Persistent memory** - Remember across conversations

## 🔐 What's New in v2.4.0

### 🚨 **Critical Security Fixes**
- **Template Injection Prevention**: Fixed critical P0 vulnerability that could allow script execution in generated files
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs now properly escaped and validated
- **XSS Protection**: Enhanced security for all generated markdown content

### ✨ **Simplified User Experience**
- **Removed Complex Percentages**: No more confusing "Setup Completeness: 73%" displays
- **Clear Status Display**: Simple "Capabilities Active: 7/10" format
- **Cleaner Interface**: Streamlined capability display with clear ✅/❌ indicators

### 🏗️ **Architecture Corrections**
- **Built-in Tool Recognition**: Correctly identifies Filesystem, Context7, and GitHub as Claude Desktop built-ins
- **No More False Positives**: Users with working setups won't get "broken configuration" warnings
- **Proper Guidance**: Directs users to Settings→Extensions and Settings→Connectors appropriately

### 🧪 **Quality & Reliability**
- **291 Test Suite**: Comprehensive testing covering all major scenarios
- **Vitest Process Fixes**: Resolved test execution issues and hanging processes
- **Error Boundaries**: Structured error handling prevents crashes
- **PE-Reviewed Code**: High quality rating with best practices compliance
