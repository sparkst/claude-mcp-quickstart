## 🎯 What is MCP Quickstart?

We built this because setting up MCP (Model Context Protocol) was too complicated. Configuration files, manual installations, environment variables... who has time for that?

**MCP Quickstart** solves this. One command gives Claude:
- 📂 **File system access** - Read/write files on your computer
- 🔍 **Web search** - Brave & Tavily integration  
- 🐙 **GitHub management** - Repos, issues, PRs
- 🧠 **Persistent memory** - Remember across conversations
