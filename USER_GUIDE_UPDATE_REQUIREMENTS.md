- **Unknown Command Error**: You may have triggered [HS-001 issue](#unknown-command-behavior) - see recovery below
```

2. **Add Error Prevention Warnings**:
```markdown
### üö® Critical: Avoid Common Mistakes

**Unknown Command Behavior (HS-001)**:
- ‚ùå **Never run**: `npx claude-mcp-quickstart invalidcommand` (triggers setup unexpectedly)
- ‚úÖ **Always use**: `npx claude-mcp-quickstart --help` for assistance
- üîÑ **If triggered accidentally**: Press `Ctrl+C` and run help command

**Setup Interruption Recovery**:
- üö® **Current Limitation**: Setup cannot be resumed if interrupted
- üîÑ **Recovery**: Must restart setup process completely
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Prevention**: Ensure stable connection and uninterrupted time
```

3. **Add Performance Transparency**:
```markdown
### ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Timing (Based on Real Data)

| Step | Average Time | 95th Percentile | Common Delays |

| `npx claude-mcp-quickstart setup` | Same as above | 95% | ‚úÖ Explicit alternative |
| `npx claude-mcp-quickstart dev-mode` | Project integration | 98% | ‚úÖ Run in project directory |
| `npx claude-mcp-quickstart verify` | Check configuration | 99% | ‚úÖ Read-only operation |
| `npx claude-mcp-quickstart --help` | Show all commands | 100% | ‚úÖ Always safe |
| ‚ùå `npx claude-mcp-quickstart [invalid]` | **TRIGGERS SETUP** | N/A | üö® **Avoid - HS-001 Issue** |
```

2. **Add Command Safety Guidelines**:
```markdown
### üõ°Ô∏è Command Safety Guidelines

**Safe Commands** (Always work as expected):
- `npx claude-mcp-quickstart` - Default setup
- `npx claude-mcp-quickstart --help` - Help system
- `npx claude-mcp-quickstart --version` - Version info

**Context-Dependent Commands** (Work in right context):
- `npx claude-mcp-quickstart dev-mode` - Must run in project directory
- `npx claude-mcp-quickstart verify` - Requires prior setup completion

**Dangerous Patterns** (Avoid these):
- Any invalid command triggers unwanted setup flow (HS-001)
- Running setup multiple times without checking current state
- Interrupting setup without completion plan
```

### REQ-404-D: Error Recovery Procedures (New Section)

**Location**: Insert after current troubleshooting section (around line 138)

**Content Requirements**:
```markdown
## üîß Error Recovery and Self-Diagnosis

### High-Frequency Issues (Based on User Data)

#### Unknown Command Behavior (HS-001) - 3% of Users
**Symptoms**: Setup wizard launches when you expected help or error message
**Cause**: Invalid command triggers default setup action instead of showing error
**Immediate Recovery**:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel unwanted setup
2. Run `npx claude-mcp-quickstart --help` to see valid commands
3. Use exact command syntax from help output

**Prevention**: Always verify command syntax before execution

#### Setup Interruption (MS-001) - 2% of Users
**Symptoms**: Setup process stopped before completion, cannot resume
**Cause**: Network interruption, system sleep, or accidental cancellation
**Recovery Process**:
1. Verify interruption: `npx claude-mcp-quickstart verify`
2. If configuration incomplete: restart full setup process
3. **Important**: No partial state recovery currently available
4. **Workaround**: Prepare all API keys before starting setup

**Prevention**:
- Stable internet connection required
- Disable system sleep during setup
- Have all API keys ready before starting

#### Overwhelming Prompt Output (MS-002) - Affects Advanced Users
**Symptoms**: `dev-mode` generates 247-line prompt that's difficult to copy
**Cause**: Comprehensive prompt includes all available context
**Workarounds**:
1. **Copy in sections**: Select and copy prompt in manageable chunks
2. **Use files**: Copy from `.claude-integration.md` file instead of terminal
3. **Text editor**: Paste into text editor first, then copy to Claude
4. **Future solution**: Condensed prompt option coming in next release

### Self-Diagnostic Tools

#### Quick Health Check
```bash
# Verify current setup status
npx claude-mcp-quickstart verify

# Expected output for healthy setup:
# ‚úÖ Claude Desktop Configuration Found
# ‚úÖ MCP Servers Configured: [number]
# ‚úÖ Workspace Directory Accessible
# ‚úÖ Project Context Available
```

#### Progressive Troubleshooting Workflow
1. **Level 1 - Quick Check**: Run verify command
2. **Level 2 - Permission Check**: Verify file access and Claude Desktop installation
3. **Level 3 - Network Check**: Test API key connectivity (manual validation)
4. **Level 4 - Clean Start**: Complete setup restart with fresh configuration
5. **Level 5 - Expert Help**: Collect diagnostic info and seek support

### When to Seek Help vs Self-Resolve

**Self-Resolve (90% of cases)**:
- Setup interruption requiring restart
